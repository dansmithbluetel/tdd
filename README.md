Make Commands

- build: Build the docker image to run the tests (Do this first!)
- test: Runs all tests in the directory *without* code coverage
- configure: Run this if you want to set up code coverage (Make sure the bootstrap script is set to '../vendor/autoload.php')
- coverage: Run tests and generate an HTML coverage report
- clear: Clears the phpunit config (Useful if you want to switch off coverage again)

The main branch is an empty sandbox 
The tests branch contains the tests from the demo but no implementation in the src directory
